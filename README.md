# Music That Matters

This website and project was developed to answer my oldest niece's question "What kind of music do you listen to?"  I gave what I considered a sub standard answer but then figured what a great project to put on a website. 

The original boilerplate came from:

The code you are reading is hardcoded like crazy and has no best practices.  It was never intended for a profesional audience.

However, there will be a SERIOUS REFRACTOR coming soon.  LOL

Thank you for taking the time to read my code,
