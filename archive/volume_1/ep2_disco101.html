				<h4>Donna Summer</h4>
				<h5>1948 to 2012</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Years performing – 1958 to 2010</li>
					<li>Rock Hall of Fame Inductee– 2013</li>
					<li>Won 5 Grammy Awards</li>
					<li>42 singles in Billboard Top 100</li>
					<li>Sold over 100,000,000 records</li>
					<li>Top 40 hit every year - 1975 to 1984</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I thought I’d start the new year out with something fabulous and shiny and bright, Donna Summer and the
					Village People. Grab your
					boogie shoes and let's get this new year started right. Donna Summer
					was unquestionably considered the “Queen of Disco” and the “complete package” because she was not a pretty
					thing wrapped in over-production or marketing. Donna Summer wrote and produced her own music, performed that
					music, and steered a 52-year career
					that included acting. The 1970s and the disco era were a time filled with vices and abundant drug use giving
					less grounded performers countless opportunities to ruin their lives or careers.
					Donna Summer was NOT one of those people, performing until 2009, three years before she died.</p>
				<p>
					Donna Summer's music was sultry and richly layered in strings, guitars, horns, and rich orchestral
					arrangements. Sometimes it was stripped down with simple instrumental arrangements but robust vocals. The
					music was thick and almost velvety in texture, and like most great dance music, was really
					sexy.</p>

				<h4>The Village People</h4>
				<h5>1977 - present</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>3 Gold Hits in the US and Germany</li>
					<li>#2 and #3 hits on Billboard Top 100</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					While the Village People's grammy count did not come even close to Donna Summer's, their impact would last for
					generations and be untouchable. Before the disco era, there were no musical artists that were out even though
					there were performers who flirted with bisexuality.
					The Village People were a cop, a construction worker, a leather daddy, a soldier, an American Native chief,
					and
					cowboy, all icons of masculinity. The back-up band was a full orchestra and the performances had non-stop
					dancing.
					They sang about gay havens such as New York City and <a
						href="https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=The_Castro:_The_Rise_of_a_Gay_Community" target="blank">San
						Fransisco.
					</a>
					I remember buying the EP for San
					Francisco / Everyone is a star in LA and having a crush on the blond guy on the extreme right side of the
					album cover above. The Village People gave us a voice, and gave drunk straight people music to dance in sports
					arenas and stadiums.
				</p>
				<p>The music and the
					titles of the music were campy with songs like Macho Man, In
					the Navy, and Sodom Gomorrah. There was a very homo-erotic movie that came called <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqeQWYwVFo0" target="blank">Can't Stop the
						Music</a> that featured Kaitlyn Jenner when she was still identifying as Bruce Jenner. The movie was
					terrible and may have helped ruin Village People's career.</p>

				<h2 class="content__text">history of disco</h2>
				<h4>Roots</h4>
				<p>
					The word disco has several meanings depending on who you talk to, but a DISCO
					is nothing more than a club that plays music that is typically spun from records, or digitally in your music
					era.
					The disco era spanned from around 1974 to 1981, and while shortlived it shaped
					American culture and music for decades to come. Every small town had some sort of disco in bowling alleys and
					hotel lobbies. Disco music was influenced heavily by the sixties soul and funk artists. The first disco music
					I
					remember hearing was from Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield on a variety show called <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oiljgi71eow" target="blank">Soul Train, </a>featuring soul, funk, and
					R&B artists. I loved the dancing and the way everybody dressed!
				</p>
				<p>Prior to the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/stonewall-riots-timeline" target="blank">Stonewall
						Riots</a> in 1969, there were no safe places for gay people to hang and dance like straight people could.
					After the gay community began to gain freedom, discos became those safe places we needed where its own culture
					was
					able to flourish. Disco music became the background music for these safe havens because dance music is ALWAYS
					sexy!

				<h5>1977</h5>

					<li>Sold 40,000,000 copies worldwide</li>
					<li>120 weeks - Billboard charts</li>
					<li>Won 5 Grammy Awards</li>

				<p>The disco era made John Travolta a star in the 1977 film
					masterpiece, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5tBXe0kSLA" target="blank">Saturday Night Fever.</a>
					It made superstars out of the Bee Gees, one of the first
					Australian bands to bust into America. The
					seventies were a time of fads with everything. The <a

					choreography.

						target="blank">Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack</a> on a
					snowy Colorado
					afternoon while I am coding out this website. I do have to say after watching the movie again recently it
					wasn't respectful to
					Italian-American people nor women. Not judging the past but it's interesting
					looking through different time perspectives. I'm listening to the soundtrack right now, and it is
					unbelievably fun all these years later, however! The other thing is John Travolta really could dance!</p>

				<h2 class="content__text">the golden era</h2>
				<h4>Studio 54</h4>
				<h5>April 1977 - January 1980</h5>
				<p>Things were bumpin' in clubs all over America in the late seventies as if there could be no tomorrow. Every
					small town had some sort of disco in bowling alleys and hotel lobbies. I can remember getting down in phy-ed
					class doing the hustle and other fun disco dances in seventh grade. Disco had its way of dressing in
					bell-bottom slacks and
					flowing dresses that looked great under dance lights. These clubs ALL had light-up dance-floors like the
					movie. </p>
				<p>The mother of clubs was in New York city called Studio 54. People went to Studio 54 to be seen and was a
					favorite hangout of celebrities such as David Bowie, Mick Jaeger, and artist Andy Warhol. Studio 54 ended up
					closing because it's owner was not paying the IRS it's taxes. The movie <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/54_(film)" target="blank">54</a> was entertaining and was a great
					snapshot of time for the disco era.</p>
				<p>One thing about the disco era was there were
					more professional musicians employed than at any other time in music history because the bands were full
					orchestras.
					Disco bands often had full orchestral string sections along with wah peddle guitars and a driving bass drum
					back-beat. The wah pedal reigned supreme as did funky rhythm guitar parts.</p>

				<h4>Comiskey Park Riot</h4>
				<h5>July 12, 1979</h5>
				<p>"Deader than disco" is how Danny Devito described his ex-wife in <i>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</i>
					While 1978 may have been disco's peak, it was dead by 1981, being replaced by Urban Cowboys or new wave muusic
					fans.
					In 1979<a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2019/07/12/disco-demolition-dahl-veeck-chicago-white-sox"
						target="blank"> a disco record
						burning event </a> in
					Comiskey Park where the Chicago White Sox play baseball in when promooters failed to control the gates. It was
					intended to promote the rock-and-roll lifestyle.
				</p>
				<p>As disco's popularity waned, it was replaced by synthesized New Wave muisc as a form of dance music. While
					there were few artists that were out during the disco era and rock era, that was going to change in the new
					wave and goth era . Disco artists such as the Village people helped open doors for future gay dance and club
					musicians
					such as the Pet Shop Boys, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and the Bronski Beat.</p>

				<h4>Donna Summer vs. the Singing Nun</h4>
				<p>
					Want to have some fun? Look up in Google the Billboard top song on the week you were born.
				</p>
				<p>After I looked mine up I was shocked by its story because I had no idea about the rabbit hole
					I found. The Beetles were about to explode in several months in 1964, so the modern rock as we know
					it hadn't
					been born yet. I knew the Billboard #1 song was going to be old school but I was expecting Pat Boone (YUCK!)
					or a girl band. I had no idea it was going to the story of the first rock star!</p>
				<p>The Billboard Magazine number one song in America the week of December 31, 1963, was a song called <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bD10bNuJYA" target="blank">Dominique</a> by The Singing Nun. Vince
					was born on July
					28, 1979, and the Billboard number one song was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d24XpO-Cn7E"
						target="blank">Bad Girl</a> by Donna Summer. A bit of a
					contrast at the first encounter. At first, I snickered and made fun of the Singing Nun. "How uncool is this
					song?"
					I said to myself. Well, the song
					isn't that captivating to me but it was a top-selling record in 11 countries for three weeks in December of
					1963. The singing nun's name was Jeannine Deckers and was a real nun who left the church because of
					differences of opinion about contraception and the role of LGBTQ people in the Catholic church. She was a
					tormented soul because she was a lesbian in the Catholic Church. She had a partner but they both found an
					early death via addiction and suicide. Her story inspired me despite how sad it is. She was the <b>FIRST</b>
					gay rock star! I feel bad because I snickered at her.</p>
