				<h4>Merry Christmas my true loves</h4>
				<p>
					This project is a nexus of several different life events that each needed to happen for their own unique
					reasons and in their own timeframe. Many years ago my brother pleaded with me to write a book about my life
					because I live distant from my family
					and you have never had a chance the learn about me, Maddie, Grace, and Hunter. He thought that I had lived a
					fascinating life and wanted me to make sure that you knew my life story and about me. We see each other when
					we are home but you never get a chance to get inside my head and share my thoughts, and, I'll tell you what,
					there's a lot going on up there sometimes. I needed to define myself and figure out what was going on, and
					after a Grand Canyon trip, I figured out that I suffer from depression and PTSD, which I would later learn was
					related to my military service. I never could come up with a way of taking the first step to make
					this project happen. I've also realized through the help of my VA counselor that our family has a history of
					mental heath issues, and that I was not exempt from being vaunerable to them,
				</p>
				<p>I want to <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/Ph5czx0t1CZhK/giphy.gif" target="blank">thank Maddie</a> for
					being the one kick-started <i>Music That Matters </i>(mtm) when she asked "What
					type
					of music do you listen to, Uncle Tim?" while we were riding home from Michigan in the Indermuehle grocery
					getter.
					My mind kept looping back to this question and the simple answer I gave at the time. It's easy to rattle a
					bunch of band
					names of but explaining the big picture and what that music meant in that time frame seemed more interesting.
					When I was learning
					web development technology in Boulder my boss liked the idea and thought that I should make it interactive
					project.
					COVID has given me time to think about what is important, and also gave me the time to start this project. Now
					that the code is written, my creative juices started flowing. I've also read while educating myself about PTSD
					that writing can be useful to veterans and people trying to cope by re-wiring the brains neural paths. Often
					times it's easier for me to write my feelings than try to verbalize them. Ask Uncle Vince what it's like when
					that train jumps that track. LOL.
				</p>

				<!--How mtm works-->
				<h4>How mtm works</h4>
				<p>
					mtm is an interactive project of words, images, thoughts and music. It's technology and it's hieroglyphics.
					It's energy and soul. It's sun, wind, earth, and water. It's life. As part of mtm, I have included an
					Indermuehle family <a href="https://www.livexlive.com" target="blank">LiveXLive</a> premium streaming music
					service. I have
					set lists that I am dying to share
					with you because each one is unique and is a snapshot of what was happening in my life. I've shared the login
					and password info separately because there are bots roaming websites looking for such information. There is no
					rhyme or reason as to why any set list is put together. Sometimes it's a vibe or feel. Some songs are included
					to contrast or compliment the setlist. Sometimes you just need to add dissonance to and otherwise dreamy,
					smooth feel. I don't know. Every kind of music you could ever imagine is available for the premium membership
					I signed up for. My only request is, Gracie, please don't listen to gangster rap in front of the church ladies
					because they prefer underground hip-hop anyway. Hahahaha! Do whetever you want, you're adults!<br>
					This is your account. Play and save and favorite music as you like. I'll be sharing my favorite set lists, but
					look forward to what YOU ALL can teach me about your music. Music is a two way street that is best shared with
					the ones you love
				</p>

				<p>In the <b>Top Picks</b> section, if you click on the album cover for each song you will be taken to the song
					on the list.</p>
				<p>
					Each episode will also include thoughts and pictures of what was happening that day in time. Any text in
					<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/424816177331972219/" target="blank">BLUE</a> is a link that may lead
					you on a side tangent. There's no order or to the
					future releases of mtm because I'm going to stop being so well planned for once, and just surrender myself to
					the flow like a canoe ride down Chipmunk Rapid. There's so much cool music in the world, and being in Conover
					doesn't lend itself to discovering new music. Have fun and always rememeber how much we love all of you.
				</p>
				<p>Sit back, click the LIveXLive link above, set the player at random please, and enjoy. <br> Merry Christmas

				<h4>A Little Background first . . . </h4>
				<p>
					It was the fall of 1981, and the internet was being born in Silicon Valley not far from where my Uncle Gary
					and his family live in San Jose, California. No internet = no streaming music = no Pandora. I was a junior, 16
					years old. I also grew
					up isolated in Kewaskum from new music scenes taking places and lands that I had no real knowledge. That all
					changed one afternoon when a kid named Scott came to physics class talking about this new cable channel called
					<b>M-TV</b> and it played music set to videos. Who would have ever thought?


				</p>
				<p>Me watching music videos , however, would have to wait until I went away to college, lived in the dorms, and
					had access to cable television. There was no cable television at Mauthe Lake. The second thing that happened,
					more
					importantly, was that the same kid told us about a
					college radio station from the Milwaukee School of Engineering, WMSE, that played <a
						href="https://www.liveabout.com/history-of-punk-rock-2803345" target="blank">punk rock</a> and <a
						href="https://musicfestnews.com/2019/10/new-wave-a-forgotten-era-in-music-history/" target="blank">new wave
					</a>
					music. While we grew up listening to public
					radio, mom and Fred's public radio, it was nothing I had ever imagined. This was my first experience hearing
					punk music, reggae, new wave, early technos and that would become EDM. Daytime on WMSE was your typical NPR
					noise and DJ,s but at six o'clock at night, I had to be home to listen to the punk show. Punk was loud,
					angry, and the words were undiscernible. The lyrics involved tearing down injustice where it was found. Many
					bands such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Kennedys" target="blank">Dead Kennedys</a>
					attacked Regan and
					the jerks that were trying to take over the country and dictate morality. For the record, a lot of the
					dysfuntionality currently has roots dating back to this time period. Some songs were twenty seconds
					long compared to the droning of twenty
					minute Led Zeppelin songs I heard on the crappy FM radio stations with commercial formats. While I can't
					remember what Vince said to me five minutes ago, I can remember that song it was
					<a href="https://www.livexlive.com/song/fear/lets-have-a-war/2358550" target="blank">Let's Have A War</a> from
					a Los Angeles
					punk band called Fear. Having grown up hearing <a href="https://www.livexlive.com/artist/carpenters"
						target="blank">The
						Carpenters</a> as background music in malls and dentist office everywhere, I knew after that first out of
					tune punk cord that I was pretty darned excited for what was about to come. It was like the first time Aunt
					Terry heard Elvis Presley, and the effects on our XXXX was similar! The thing that I most identified with this
					music was that someone else was as withdrawn and kind of angry as I was at the time. Lyric's by the lead
					singer of the Pretender's, Krissi Hynde, said things that never, ever would have come out of Karen Carpenter's
					mouth. I most admired about her was that she sang the same was as men and didn't let her be restrained by the
					way a lady was "supposed" to talk. It was raw and real.

				<h4>Radio Doctors, Third & Wells Streets, Milwaukee</h4>
				<p>
					In June of 1982 I left for bootcamp ten states away at Fort Benning, Georgia, and when I returned to
					Wisconsin in September I was a profoundly differnt person. I had been exposed to lots of new people and also
					new music but the new music I had discovered befoire I left home still burned deep in my soul. When I returned
					home with a fat wad of cash in my bank account one of my first stops was a now defunct record store in
					downtown Milawaukee called <b>Radio Doctors</b>b> at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FdSUahvEY6TsZsJf9"
						target="blank">Third and Wells
						streets.</a> I remember that this was one of the first of many crappy neighborhoods I was going to
					see in my life, a contrats to the sasfe haven of white privalge we grew up in in Kewaskum. I din't feel in
					danger but boot camp had taught me to be aware of my surroundings and to not look for trouble because
					trouble
					is surely looking for you. Anyhow, it was like the universe exploded in my face like the rainbows and
					glitters
					of an exploding unicorn! There was so much music and I wanted to hear it all. Like all record stores it
					reaked
					of incense and weed odor on the employees.
				</p>
				<h4>Rock Lobsters and a puppy named Quiche Lorraine</h4>
				<p>
					And there it was, my first B-52's and first new wave album called "Party Mix". It was like art that I had
					never seen before. The Kate Pierson and Cindy xxxx's beehive hair doos reminded me of my Grandma Irene's hair,
					but bigger. It was colorful, it was art. For some odd reson there was something special about two of the guys
					in the band. All right, special is not the word but HOT might have been the better choice of words. What was
					happening was that what is called "GAYDAR" was starting to awaken in me. Gaydar is this weird thing that
					sometimes tells gay men there are other gay men near. It's not perfect but sometimes it's frighteninly
					accurate. In this case, the B-52's were one of the first out gay bands who were going to be affected by the
					HIV pandemioc in the near future.
				</p>
				<p>
					I raced home with my bounty of three records from Radio Doctors. They were my highly coveted "Party Mix,
					"Damaged" by LA punk band Black Flag, and "In God We Trust, incorporated" by San Fransisco punk band The Dead
					Kennedy's. Dad's Technics turntable and receiver never sounded better in my humble opinion. I definately
					rocked thre house loud enough that the beagle didn't come out of hiding for days.

				</p>
				<p>When I moved to Menomonie in 1983 to start a thirty year college career, I had managed to collect all of the
					vinyl relaeases by the B-52's, and Party Mix, my first, was still number one on my list. I had managed to
					collect a dozen other alternative and punk music albums. Ater moving to Colorado in 1987 after five years in
					Hotel Restaraunt management at Stout, I saw the B-52's at <a href="https://www.redrocksonline.com"
						target="blank">Red Rocks Music Ampitheater</a> near <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MPu6rFrc7a8wATeW9"

				<p>I was your typical confused boy at that point, a junior in high school, who was waiting to bust out of his
					geek bubble only to find that I had turned in to a bigger geek, just cooler. The puberty monster was
					definately wrecking havok on me. My hairy toes that freaked me out the first day of puberty was long forgotten
					as I dealt with being the only gay kid in three counties (I would later realize I was completely wrong,
					hahaha!) Regan was president, the economy
					sucked, and there was the ever present threat of thermo-nuclear anihalation brought on by the USSR. I was
					basicslly a geeky, happy kid. I liked skiing. I liked taking pictures. Unlike my father and brother who were
					grerat hunters, I was happy bird hunting and squirrel hunting. Dad trusted me to use his truck so I spent a
					lot of time bombing around with your father. Despite how awkward I felt, I was pretty happy</p>
				<p>After boot camp in 1982, I was defenitely rocking the free world. My first place away from home was waiting
					for me, and the world I knew was exploding.</p>
