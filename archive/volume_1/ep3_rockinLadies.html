				<h4>You rock Grace!</h4>
				<h5>Feliz cumplea√±os 14</h5>
				<p>No social justice essays this week. No long disertations about human suffering and how we overcome it through
					music. No
					Friedrich Nietzsche philosophy lessons, only music from some awesome female artists and players. This is one
					of my Heinz 57 set lists I made while I was driving Lyft in which I wanted to
					pay
					tribute to the lady artists I have been singing along with the last fifty years. Everytime a song came on that
					I liked I threw it on this set-list. There is no texture, genre, or feel that I focus on as in some of my set
					other lists
					lists, just random selections. The only place you can hear Lita Ford, Rita Marley and Olivia Newton John in
					the same set list is here at <i>Music That Matter!</i></p>
				<p>
					We wish we
					were there to celebrate with you but it just makes the month of August that much sweeter when we are home.
					Vince will be flying out for a few days and I'm coming home for ten days. Anywho, happy birthday Grace, and
					here is an awesome set list for you!

					This is a true gem. I was looking to find a link to the <a content__link
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadicated:_A_Tribute_to_the_Grateful_Dead" target="blank"><b>
							Deadicated</b></a> album on
					LivexLive, a Grateful Dead tribute performed by various artists. The compilation is a rainforest benefit
					album, with significant proceeds from its sale being donated to the Rainforest Action Network and Cultural
					Survival. Suzannne Vega has a great cover of <a content__link

					that was written by Bob Weir and first recorded on his solo project <i>Ace.</i>
				</p>
				<p>Suzanne Vega and her band performed earlier in the evening prior to the Dead's performance. At intermission
					Jerry Garcia approached Suzanne Vega about performing at the beginning of second set, and I remember reading
					Suzanne Vega's interview in Rolling Stone about how nervous she felt at the time. According to Vega, Jerry was
					kind and invited her to perform with the band. People performing with the Dead was virtually unheard of
					because it is hard for other musicians to mesh with their rythm and not-common cord progressions. I saw Jerry
					unplug Steve Miller's guitar in the middle of The Other One when Steve Miller was being a dork in Las Vegas in
					1992 as a testiment to what I just said. </p>
				<p>The <a content__link
						href="https://www.jambase.com/article/guests-galore-join-grateful-dead-in-1988-at-madison-square-garden"
						target="blank"> <b> YouTube video </b>
					</a>shows complete and total musical chaos as the performers try to figure each other out and what the
					hell is going on. (The
					video is a hand held audience shot so please excuse the poor quality.) The first attempt at <i>Chinese
						Bones</i> is a complete disaster but Vega turns to the drummers, re-groups, and takes charge of the song.
					Slowly they all pull it together; you can see Weir and Garcia
					watching Vega's right hand and the cords she is playing. At about 2 minutes 50 seconds of the video someting
					unthinkable happens! Gerry is actually DANCING ALONG with the song, something I rarely saw in the thirty plus
					times I saw the Dead. Usually the only movement from Jerry was him scratching himself or smoking a cigarette
					at which time the ausience would erupt in auplause for no apparent reason. Halfway through Suzanne Vega's song
					<i>Neighborhood Girls</i>
					they sound like a well oiled machine and it begins to sound like the normal Dead we we're used to hearing.
					Jerry Yells "I love neighborhood girls" in the background as she introduces the song. How Suzanne Vega takes
					charge of someone elses is band pays testiment to her musical ability, and like I said, this is a true musical
					gem.</p>
