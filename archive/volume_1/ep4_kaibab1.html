						Plateau </a> is a 1,152 square mile plateau located in Arizona between Grand Canyon National Park and the

					wilderness area to the west and the Navjo Nation to to the east making, it is one of the least
					populated
					regions in the lower 48. While the surounding area is part of the Colorado Plateau at 3500 feet above
					sea level, the Kaibab is located between
					8000 and 9200 feet with a more temperate climate with temperatures rarely
					topping out above 85 degress. The yearly North American monsoon event in July and August brings
					afternoon thunderstorms everyday and the resulting afternoon rainbows. It is a beautiful
					ponderosa pine & aspen forest filled with deer and <a content__link

						<h6 class="text-danger">Click album covers for music links</h6>
						<i>My Brother Essau</i> is a 1987 single that was a B-side song to the 45 rpm record <i>Touch of Grey.</i>
						Before MP3 music and compact disks, music was played in bars on jukeboxes on 45rpm records at a cost of a
						quarter for three songs. It is a
						classic Bob Weir spacey strange song that references brothers Esau and Jacob in the book of Genesis, and the
						relationship with their father. The warrior brother is held in revernece by their father until he comes back
						a failure when America loses its first war in Vietnam.
						<br><br> The line "Yet sometimes at night I dream,
						he's still that hairy man.
						Shadowboxing the apocalypse, wandering the land" resonates with me for some reason.

						"Tom's Diner" is a acapela song written in 1982 by American singer and songwriter Suzanne Vega. It was first
						released on a studio album in 1987 and then became a bootleg cult classic. Vega discoverd the pirate copies
						and, instead of pressing charges, put them on a compilation albom called <i>Tom's Album.</i> The songs
						range from hip-hop to EDM to pure lounge music. <br><br>Because the
						song was used by German sound engineers to develop the compression format that would becoome MP3, Suzanne
						Vega earned the title "The Mother of the MP3"

				<h4>Eagle's Nest Ridge, Vail Mountain</h4>
				<h5>Winter '91</h5>
				<p>This photo was taken the winter of 1991 with my roommates Scott and Colleen on the top of Chair 2 on Vail
					Mountain. Scott had the best butt on Vail Mountain and Colleen loves Milli Vanilli. I can tell that it was
					1991 becase I was on alpine skis and I hadn't started growing my pony tail
					yet. The winds of change were blowing, however, and my life was going to be headed toward Northern Arizona in
					the near future and there was going to be no going back.
				</p>
				<p>In the winters I worked for a Vail Ski Rentals as a ski shop assistant manager at the base of Vail Mountain,
					and in the summers I worked for a raft company called Raftmeister with a bunch of groovy people that I am
					still
					friends with and still raft with. I was reading everything I could get my hands on by author <a
						href="https://www.abbeyweb.net/introduction.html" target="blank">Edward Abbey,</a> a naturalist and fiction
					writer who lived on the Colorado Plateau and fought to protect it until the day he died. His most famous work
					of fiction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey_Wrench_Gang" target="blank">The Monkey Wrench
						Gang</a> is the story of river runners and the Grand Canyon, and I aways saw myself as the character Seldom
					seen Smith, the river guide. Edward Abbey was a chauvinist and highly controversial because he was
					one of the fathers of eco-terrorism but also wrote BEAUTIFUL naturalist writing in the tradition of Aldo
					Leopold and John Muir.</p>
				<p>I had been guiding rafts for three years and had experienced a limited amount of high water during run-off
					and had only heard aboout the big water years in 1983 and 1984 when <a
						href="http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/GCDAMP/GCDAMPchronicle/1983FloodGCDhannon.pdf"
						target="blank">Glen Canyon Dam</a> was almost destroyed. I had dreamed of seeing a historic snow year and
					seeing historic high water. </p>
				<p>I've heard of an acient Chinese curse that goes something like <i>"May you get
						everything you ever wished for." </i> There was a historic snow year waiting for me to find it but I will
					fill you in on that one later my fabulous darlings . . . . . . . . . </p>

				<h4>This week's Space Cat shout-out goes to my friend Leslie Forstner.</h4>
				<p>She's a bad-ass canyon momma that loves the Grand Canyon as much as I do! She was the team leader of twelve
					of the most
					eclectic people I have ever met. We drank a ton of beer and merlot on North Rim viewpoints
					together, and I
					know she wishes she had freakin' lasars coming out of her hands a few times. For the record, we were a poorly behaved staff a majority of the time.  For this reason, and many others, she gets a space cat shout-out. Whoo-hoo!
				</p>
				<p>Thank you for being our friend Leslie and giving me the gift of the Grand Canyon, the most beautiful lady
					I've ever met. After I ate shit on Lava my third trip down,  the canyon convinced me to finally seek help for my PTSD and move on.</p>
